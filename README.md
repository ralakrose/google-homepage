This project involves a page built to resemble the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS only.
The image and icons are from existing websites which I linked to the index.html file to access them directly from the website.
The index.html file has also been linked to style.css (on my local machine) which is where all the code behind the styling of the page is.
The buttons/links are not linked to any functions but the achievement of making it look like the Google homepage is what I was aiming for.
